<h3>Ok, I admit it!</h3>
<p>I'm a Star-Wars fan. Jedi is in fact an acronym of the dutch sentence 'Jong En Dynamische Informatica', which translates as Young and Dynamic It. During the past years, it has become my personal brand, somewhat hidden from the crowd.
I'm currently a proud member of the <a href="http://www.sos.be">Supporting Open Source</a>. A bunch of professionals working in various branches of IT, specializing in infrastructure work.</p>
